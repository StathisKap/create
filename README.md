Program that creates a folder, a git repo, a readme file, and a C file with the name that you pass it, in a given path


There is a variable named path, so if you wanna use this command, first change the path to whatever you want,
and then add the command to the PATH of your computer.
Then use gcc or any other C compiler to make it run.

In the future you will be able to use flags to enter text in the README.md file, change the path from the command line, add the remote and more.
